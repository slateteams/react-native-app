# SPM Migration Quick Start Guide

## ðŸš€ Immediate Next Steps

Now that you have the comprehensive SPM migration plan, here's how to get started **today**:

## 1. Initial Assessment (15 minutes)

Run the analysis to understand your current setup:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root
cd /path/to/react-native-app

# Run dependency analysis
./scripts/spm-migration-tools.sh analyze
```

This will show you:
- All current CocoaPods dependencies
- Which ones already have SPM support
- Current dependency tree complexity

## 2. Create Safety Backup (5 minutes)

```bash
# Create a complete backup before starting
./scripts/smp-migration-tools.sh backup

# Create a migration branch
git checkout -b feature/spm-migration
git push -u origin feature/spm-migration
```

## 3. Set Up Migration Infrastructure (10 minutes)

```bash
# Create initial Package.swift
./scripts/spm-migration-tools.sh create-package

# Validate the setup
./scripts/spm-migration-tools.sh validate

# Check current status
./scripts/spm-migration-tools.sh status
```

## 4. Coordinate with iOS Team (This Week)

### Meeting Agenda Template

**Subject**: SPM Migration Coordination Meeting

**Attendees**: iOS Team Lead, React Native Team, Project Manager

**Agenda**:
1. **Timeline Review** (10 min)
   - Share the 20-week migration plan
   - Identify any conflicts with iOS team priorities
   - Agree on weekly checkpoint meetings

2. **Slate Dependencies Priority** (15 min)
   - Review the 14 Slate repositories that need SPM conversion
   - Confirm priority order: FMLib â†’ FMRendering â†’ FMSharing...
   - Assign ownership for each repository conversion

3. **Technical Coordination** (10 min)
   - Establish naming convention: `ios-xxx-spm` repositories
   - Agree on version tagging strategy
   - Set up shared Slack channel for updates

4. **Resource Allocation** (5 min)
   - Identify iOS team members for SPM conversion work
   - Estimate effort for each repository conversion
   - Plan resource allocation over migration timeline

### iOS Team Action Items
- [ ] Create SPM repositories for Slate dependencies (start with `ios-fm-lib-spm`)
- [ ] Provide SPM Package.swift templates
- [ ] Share repository access credentials
- [ ] Set up SPM package hosting/distribution strategy

## 5. Start with High-Impact, Low-Risk Dependencies (This Week)

Begin with dependencies that already have SPM support:

```bash
# Generate templates for the first Slate dependencies
./scripts/spm-migration-tools.sh template FMLib 1.1.32
./scripts/spm-migration-tools.sh template FMRendering 1.2.5
```

This creates ready-to-use templates that the iOS team can populate with source code.

## 6. Set Up Parallel Development (Next Week)

Create a hybrid approach while the iOS team works on Slate dependencies:

```bash
# Create hybrid Podfile (React Native only)
./scripts/spm-migration-tools.sh create-hybrid

# Test the hybrid build
./scripts/spm-migration-tools.sh build
```

## ðŸ“‹ Your First Week Checklist

- [ ] **Day 1**: Run analysis and create backup
- [ ] **Day 1**: Schedule iOS team coordination meeting
- [ ] **Day 2**: Create migration branch and initial Package.swift
- [ ] **Day 3**: iOS team meeting and action item assignment
- [ ] **Day 4**: Generate SPM templates for first 3 Slate dependencies
- [ ] **Day 5**: Set up hybrid Podfile and test build

## ðŸŽ¯ Week 1 Success Criteria

By end of week 1, you should have:
1. âœ… Complete understanding of current dependencies
2. âœ… Migration branch with initial SPM infrastructure
3. âœ… iOS team aligned and assigned specific responsibilities
4. âœ… Templates ready for iOS team to begin conversion
5. âœ… Hybrid build working (React Native + some SPM dependencies)

## ðŸš¨ Quick Troubleshooting

### If `./scripts/spm-migration-tools.sh` doesn't work:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/spm-migration-tools.sh
```

### If Package.swift validation fails:
```bash
# Check Swift version (need 5.9+)
swift --version

# Clean and retry
./scripts/spm-migration-tools.sh clean
./scripts/spm-migration-tools.sh validate
```

### If build fails after hybrid setup:
```bash
# Revert to CocoaPods temporarily
./scripts/spm-migration-tools.sh revert

# Check what went wrong and fix, then try again
```

## ðŸ“ž Need Help?

1. **Technical Issues**: Check the full migration plan in `docs/SPM_Migration_Plan.md`
2. **Process Questions**: Review the checklist in `docs/SPM_Migration_Checklist.md`
3. **Emergency**: Use `./scripts/spm-migration-tools.sh revert` to go back to working state

## ðŸŽ‰ Next Steps After Week 1

Once you complete the first week:
1. Begin Phase 2: Dependency Conversion (following the detailed plan)
2. Start with Firebase migration (already has SPM support)
3. Work with iOS team on first Slate dependency (FMLib)
4. Set up CI/CD for hybrid builds

Remember: **This is a 20-week migration**. Week 1 is about foundation and coordination. Don't rush - the planning and coordination you do now will save months of problems later.

## ðŸ“Š Track Your Progress

Use this command to monitor your migration status:
```bash
./scripts/spm-migration-tools.sh status
```

Good luck! ðŸš€
